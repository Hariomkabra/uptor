## Workshop - Meghplat Skill-Building Space
Hello! This is the Workshop section of my Meghplat project—a hands-on learning area I’ve developed as a Full Stack Developer intern. It’s a sub-project of Meghplat, live on Netlify, and I’m excited to share this interactive piece with you.
## What’s This About?
This repo powers the Workshop page, where users can join live coding sessions and skill-building activities. It’s designed to enhance the main Meghplat experience, and I’ve loved building it to be engaging and functional.

Interactive Tools: Hands-on practice for skills.
Integration: Ties back to the main Meghplat site.
